Editors notes:

  - This contribution received positive comments from US

  - US made the point that the incubation queue and management didn’t
    come in Q1 because the experts where not there but US pointed that
    the experts will go where the work will be done and so if the
    incubation queue and management would come to Q1, experts will come
    there. A new text proposes to fix this view which was what CG-XSS
    expressed so far in 2.4.3

  - US made another point that 2.2.1 needs to take the opportunity to
    make a few reminders given an apparent lack of knowledge on the
    topic. A new text proposes to fix this

  - US made the point that today the incubation is not mentioned in Q4
    new question text and asks this to be fixed as a continuation.
    Editor noted that this matches with Proposition 4 of the incubation
    allocation special session

  - Kenya asked clarification regarding centralised and distributed
    incubation mechanisms that will be developed later. Editor explained
    that this corresponded to the fact that in the structure of SG17 in
    CG-XSS, Q6 rapporteur came with a very interesting concept and
    structure in which Working Parties are very stable and there is the
    concept of mother question. Editors hinted this answer in section
    2.4.3 but will expose deeper in section 4.

  - Q1 coordination meeting showed a weakness in that Q1 was not
    informed like Q4 immediately after the incubation allocation about
    the changes of allocation of some NWI and therefore Q1 was
    disaligned in the coordination meeting. Editors changed 2.3.2

  - References will need to be completed at the end of the development
    of this TP.

1.  # Introduction 
    
    1.  ## Context

ITU-T Study Group 17 (SG17) scope being security, it covers a domain
which is under a very strong evolution at a much faster pace than a 4
years term cadence.

There are many forces in action driving a lot of innovation such as:

  - Strong arm race between attackers and defenders

  - The general Digitalization mega-trend driving general innovation
    (AI, DLT, etc.)

  - A fundamental singularity moment is approaching called post-quantum

  - A strong change in the policy and regulatory frameworks at country
    and regional levels (e.g. GDPR)

In this context, SG17 took the initiative to develop a strategy of
transformation of security studies through a correspondence group called
CG-xss. This correspondence group and the associated special sessions on
transformation of security studies delivered a strategy in three steps
where the first step was about the creation of an incubation mechanism
to deal with innovation at a much more timely manner.

Whilst this incubation mechanism proved to be successful in pilot, a lot
of the documentation describing it got diluted in too many temporary
documents. It was therefore felt the need for a reference live document
that can codify this incubation mechanism and fundamentally
incrementally answer the question: how to bring innovation in
cybersecurity standardisation in Study Group 17 in a timely manner?

This document proposes a technical paper whose purpose is precisely to
answer this question. As any mechanism can be improved it will as well
review and analyse what other SDOs are doing to bring innovation and
perhaps it will help SG17 to constantly review and improve this
mechanism.

## Problem Statement

In the above context, the problem that this document resolves is:

|                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How to bring innovation in cybersecurity standardisation in Study Group 17 in a timely manner? |

## Why the need for an innovation path in SG17?

Bringing innovation in any Study Group means sometimes that the topic
brought by contribution doesn’t fit in the current structure and
changing the structure is always a difficult and risky task for a large
spectrum of reasons discussed in another technical paper
\[TP.sgstruct\].

This situation leads to a gap and a tension between

  - the willingness to accept valid contributions and let them develop
    in SG17 versus,

  - the need to find them a place where to develop which was not thought
    through initially in the structure and changing the structure will
    take time.

With a number of sector members in need to bring their contributions it
was necessary to find a solution to this problem and relax the pressure
to change reactively and perhaps unwisely the structure without any long
term vision.

In fact innovation poured already in SG17 with an instance of 14
contributions on DLT to one of SG17 meetings resulting in the
establishment of a creative adhoc approach but too in a very big and
short notice change in the agenda of the whole meeting generating
challenges for small delegations.

## Why considering an innovation path in SG17 “now”?

SG17 evolved incrementally over the years but security evolved at a much
faster pace due, as per the above context, to a number of factors, in
which we find the

  - Strong arm race between attackers and defenders lead to a large
    range of innovations
    
      - including a fundamental singularity moment approaching, called
        post-quantum

  - Digitalization mega-trend driving general innovation (AI, DLT, etc.)
    which fuelled both
    
      - the attackers and the defenders weaponry but, too,
    
      - created a huge inflation in the attack surface in many ways

  - Increased awareness of
    
      - all the business constituencies of the importance of security
        and the need to invest
    
      - policy makers and regulators across the globe towards security
    
      - civil society to counterweight security with privacy centric
        concerns
    
      - academia which matured a lot and open new frontiers for security

  - Shortage of skills, talents, resources and professionalisation
    
      - Which accelerates the need for best practices and standards to
        simplify the jobs

All of these factors combined together explain why innovation
accelerated with investments to a degree that it outpaced the
incremental evolution of SG17

## What solution could fulfil this gap?

ITU-T operates with a number of rules and processes and it became clear
that they were limits to find a creative solution. Yet, like it is
discussed in \[TP.sgstruct\], making the comparison that a Study Group
is like a Company was rich enough to inspire a solution from industry.

Indeed, when organizations need to launch a new business, as it is
coming with a number of risks, sometimes the solution used is to
incubate the innovation until it is solid enough that the organization
can qualify what to really do with this new business: spinoff a new
company, rearrange business units, etc.

The approach taken by businesses regarding startups lead them too to
create the concept of incubators.

Inspired by these approaches, the idea of an incubation mechanism for
SG17 started to gain mindshare until it became a reality. Once the
principle was agreed, the question that needed to be addressed was how
to design it and implement it.

This is the purpose of this document.

2.  # The incubation mechanism
    
    1.  ## General Description

The incubation mechanism is a mechanism that allows any contribution for
a new work item which

  - is valid and is reasonable for SG17 to study

  - but doesn’t fit exactly in the current structure of SG17 and

  - therefore, cannot find a host question

to be still developed by SG17 until it is finished or allocated to its
final question.

### A mechanism in two parts

It infers the requirement that the candidate new work items can be
placed in a staging area in SG17.

This means that this mechanism needs:

  - A way to allocate the candidate new work items into this staging
    area

  - That this staging area acts an incubation queue where candidate new
    work items are inserted, managed like any new work item in any
    normal work program, as well as reallocated to their final question

We will call

  - the staging area the incubation queue

  - a work item in the incubation queue as an incubated work item

  - a new work item candidate for incubation as incubation new work item

  - the co-rapporteur in charge of the management of the incubation
    queue as the incubation co-rapporteur

  - the question carrying the incubation queue and the incubation
    management as the incubation question

We recognize that the incubation mechanism will consist of two parts
during SG17 meetings

  - “The incubation mechanism part 1” will designate the allocation of
    the new work items and will also be called “incubation allocation”

  - “The incubation mechanism part 2” will designate the management of
    the queue and the new work items and will also be called “incubation
    management”

Figure 1 - General flow of the incubation mechanism in two parts
allocation and management

![](media/image2.png)

We understand too that each part needs to be hosted by an entity

  - The allocation part needs to be attached to SG17 as it concerns
    allocations that may need arbitrations across the Study Group
    between questions and it needs to be handled as early as possible in
    the Study Group.

  - The management part needs to be attached to a question as this is
    mostly management of a work program and requires the skills of a
    rapporteurship
    
    1.  ## Incubation mechanisms constituencies
        
        1.  ### The incubation work item

An incubation work item is a normal work item that is placed in the
incubation queue. We remind here that work items can be of various
types: 

  - Recommendation

  - 
  - Technical Report

  - Technical Paper

  - Etc.

And there are various approval processes

  - Traditional Approval Process (TAP) (for recommendations)

  - Accelerated Approval Process (AAP) (for recommendations)

  - Agreement (For Technical Report, Technical Paper)

We note and remind here that:

  - If a Recommendation was initially set to TAP it cannot be changed to
    AAP later

  - If a Recommendation was initially set to AAP it can be changed to
    TAP later

We observe that as we are in innovation path, it is a good practice to
encourage Technical Papers as contribution for new work items in the
incubation queue as they can act as a feasibility study which is a
lightweight way to qualify potential future contributions and help
delegates to familiarize themselves with a certain topic before
standardization is engaged and contributions for new work items for
recommendations are submitted.

### Candidate incubation new work items

A candidate new work item is a new work item that shows a difficulty to
be placed into a specific question. The below table shows some examples
where a potential new work item would be acceptable as such but would be
difficult to place in a specific question

Table 1 - Examples of potential new work items candidate for incubation

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Reason</th>
<th>Example of a potential new work item topic that would fall in the category</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Question’s mandate doesn’t cover the topic</td>
<td>Artificial Intelligence</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Question’s mandate is too restrictive for the topic</td>
<td>Q8 doesn’t cover Big Data</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Question’s mandate has a dependency with another SDO that forbids the scope of the contribution</td>
<td>Q3 has specific agreements with ISO that may limit what it can cover</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ITU received a mandate that forbids the topic</td>
<td>Ad spam is at the edge of security and content</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>The topic can legitimately be supported by multiple questions because the topic was never properly recognized, positioned in SG17, or because there are overlaps between questions</td>
<td><p>Big Data appeared in Q2, Q7, Q8?</p>
<p>Should SDN/NFV with Q6 or Q8?</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The topic can exist in the question mandate but the real meaning of the contribution shows a disalignment</td>
<td>Relates to the allocation of KT Quantum work item. Did we really consider the right reasons to put it in Q2? Shouldn’t it have been more explicated about the architecture implications regarding middleboxes first?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As we see from the above table, the first line shows a true canonical
example of a new work item being proposed on an innovation that is valid
but no question has a mandate to support it yet.

What is interesting is that innovation will lead some new work items to
be in the scope of SG17 as it is today but the structure doesn’t fit or
other reasons are creating frictions to get this new work item in its
final destination.

This leads us to the requirement to produce a list of clear criteria to
select candidate new work items

### Allocation criteria for candidate incubation new work items

The below table lists the criteria to allocate new work items as
candidate incubation new work items

### The incubation queue

The incubation queue is a specialized work program consisting of
incubated work items

  - The incubation queue is a normal work program and as such the
    incubated work items
    
      - Are there if it was agreed normally by SG17 plenary meeting
    
      - Are represented normally in the database of the work program
    
      - Are being developed normally by contributions and by updating
        TDs
    
      - Are determined or consented and then approved normally
    
      - Or can be removed from the work program

  - In addition to a normal work program an incubated work item
    
      - Can be reallocated to an existing (and/or new) question

  - It is recommended to review the incubation queue as
    
      - Its counter of incubated work items is a good measurement of the
        fit of the Study Group structure to the reality of what
        standardisation requires:
        
          - No incubated work items means that the Study Group Structure
            fits the requirements of standardisation in the limits of
            the ITU mandates, limits and constraints
        
          - A few incubated work items shows that the Study Group
            Structure starts to degrade
        
          - Many incubated work items shows that the Study Group
            Structure is not adapted
    
      - An analysis of its content incubated work items are visible in
        the queue, they demonstrate that the Study Group “captured” a
        valuable set of work that may trigger the generation of a new
        question or the adaptation of an existing question but in any
        case this decision will now be with a decreased risk because
        there is a good seizable view on the what needs to be considered
        for standardization

    1.  ## Incubation mechanism part 1 – Incubation allocation 
        
        1.  ### To which entity to attach the allocation part

The incubation mechanism part 1 is the allocation part and is attached
to SG17 directly as it needs to do arbitrations between questions
according to the clear list of allocation criteria above.

The allocation part is carried by a special session just after the
opening plenary of SG17.

### How is the special session of incubation allocation organized?

Given the growing size of SG17 it is expected that each question sends
at least one of its rapporteur, co-rapporteur or associate rapporteur.

Prior to the meeting, the special session chairman

  - Reviews the list of contributions

  - Extracts to the best of his capacities the list of contributions
    that match the allocation criteria

  - Identifies the contributions

  - Creates an agenda and submit it as a TD

During the meeting, the special session chairman

  - Provides any updates on the incubation mechanism

  - Ask the audience if there are any missing contributions that should
    be considered

  - Goes through the proposed list and for each candidate
    
      - Discuss the reasons for why this item is in the candidate list
    
      - Obtain either meeting agreement to send this candidate to
        incubation queue or to allocate it to a final agreed question

  - Discuss any other topics

After the meeting, the special session chairman

  - Delivers immediately the table of NWI allocation to both the
    rapporteurs of the incubation question and the coordination question
    so that
    
      - The incubation question can adapt its agenda
    
      - The coordination question can prepare its coordination meeting
        with potential changes from TSB allocation documents to
        facilitate SG17 work

  - Delivers as soon as possible a report to make sure that any other
    question in need can make the changes in its agenda
    
    1.  ## Incubation mechanism part 2 – Incubation management 
        
        1.  ### To which entity to attach the incubation management

The incubation queue needs to be attached to a question as this is the
only entity which is able to manage a work program.

To support this work, the question needs to be supported by a
co-rapporteur in charge of the incubation mechanism management, the
incubation co-rapporteur

### Incubation co-rapporteur

As the incubation queue can receive arbitrary contribution on very edge
innovation topics this imposes some requirements on rapporteurs who are
managing the incubation queue.

The candidates are following all up-to-date values of a selection with
<span class="underline">no discrimination of any kind</span>

The core requirements for candidates are:

  - Proven experience in rapporteurship

  - High expertise in core security

  - High expertise in innovation management and associated topics

The incubation co-rapporteur does

  - A normal job as any other co-rapporteur managing a work program

  - In addition, the incubation co-rapporteur while
    
      - participating in question meeting
        
          - Informs the participant of any confirmed question being
            created, modified or deleted by SG17 and new SG17 structure
            updates relevant
    
      - participating in the question report
        
          - Informs SG17 about the current count of work items in the
            incubation queue and identifies the work items
        
          - Identifies the incubated work items in a table in the report
        
          - Obtain consensus for potential incubated work items to be
            allocated in their final question to be approved in SG17
            closing plenary
        
          - Alerts SG17 if any of the below happens:
            
              - The incubation queue is too big
            
              - There is need for more resources or specific skills to
                manage the queue on specific topics
        
          - Analyses the incubation queue to seek if there are any
            suggestions for SG17 to consider potentially proposing a
            modification or the creation of a question

  - Finally the incubation co-rapporteur is encouraged to participate to
    the relevant correspondence group about the short, mid and long term
    transformation of SG17
    
    1.  ### To which question to attach the incubation queue

The rationale for selecting the incubation question flows
**<span class="underline">in the current SG17 structure</span>**
**<span class="underline">and distribution of experts</span> was as
below**

  - We cannot create new questions so we cannot create a “Question 0” as
    incubation question. However a “Question 0” could be interpreted as
    covering the scope of “Emerging technologies” could have multiple
    benefits at the expense of creating a new question

  - Q1 could take work items in its current setup as there are no
    experts in this question, this is a coordination question. The
    Incubation new role requires expertise to do the peer reviews and
    offer a normal good conditions for the work item to develop. Yet
    should there be a solid incubation co-rapporteur 1) experts would
    come where the work is being done and 2) it would regroup the
    incubation queue and management with the coordination question

  - None of Q3, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q12, Q13 nor Q14 can carry
    the role because they have today a specific purpose (right or wrong
    doesn’t matter here) and are specialized unless we would opt for a
    distributed incubation queue mechanism vs a central queue mechanism
    but this would require to go with a very specific structure of SG17
    with a number of assumptions:
    
      - Principle of stable long term Working Parties
    
      - Principle of ‘mother’ question in each Working Party

This would resolve some problems of work load but would make the
incubation allocation probably much harder

  - Rests Q2 about Architecture and Frameworks and Q4 Cybersecurity

Both Q2 and Q4 are reasonable candidates to host, at this stage, the
incubation question.

However looking deeper we see that a requirement is on expertise to give
good review, support for the work item development. Indeed just looking
at the above examples in previous section we see that we need quite of a
significant expertise in core security vs architecture. Ideally, we
would need both\! And it might happen in the future that we have both
together or we switch depending of what the SG17 new structure might be.

So, with this new requirement in mind it becomes clear that Q4 is right
now the best candidate but with Q2 as the next one.

We therefore proposed Q4 to host the incubation role and mechanism at
this stage

We note that the future structure of SG17 may change this allocation

3.  # Benefits and Risks of the incubation mechanism
    
    1.  ## Benefits of the incubation mechanism

The main benefit of this proposal is to

  - Allow decorrelation of transformation of the SG17 structure vs the
    adoption of new work items that do not fit the SG17 structure

  - Simplify the flow of SG17 meetings by bringing forward the
    allocation part

  - Accept key innovation in SG17 in a much more agile manner

  - Therefore
    
      - Give proper time to the relevant correspondence groups to
        conduct their job and make recommendations regarding the long
        term transformation of SG17 and the evolution of its structure
    
      - Allow the work on the development of good validated new work
        items not be delayed and support legitimate requests from sector
        members

  - Furthermore
    
      - Offer a good tool for SG17 to accelerate innovation probably
        quite significantly
    
      - At the same time, be conservatist and cautious in terms of its
        future big bets and new structure
    
      - Use this new tool to help communicate a good story to hire new
        members and participation
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    1.  ## Risks of the incubation mechanism

Like any proposal nothing comes with only advantages there are, and it
is important to be opened here, there are risks too

### Risk of doing

There are risk of doing. The main risks lie into:

  - R1 The queue grows too fast and is difficult to manage vs resources

  - R2 Special expertise required is not available

  - R3 The incubation mechanism is abused to delay work

Mitigation Suggestions

  - R1 can be mitigated by the possibility for the co-rapporteur to
    alert SG17 through normal reporting

  - R2 can be mitigated by the growing number of experts joining the
    ITU-T but in case of severe shortage on a specific topic SG17 will
    need to campaign to attract the relevant new members

  - R3 can be mitigated by SG17 members and by discussions. SG17 has a
    strong family spirit as a community
    
    1.  ### Risk of not doing

The risk of not doing means that there is no flexibility to allow the
team to develop new work items in good conditions, it will increase
significantly the coordination level, it will eventually lead to more
arbitrariness in new structure decisions. In fact it will ossify
significantly SG17 and make it will require a major ‘step function’ to
get out of a dangerous ‘plateau effect’.

### Risk of not doing now or stopping it

The situation will **block** as it will not allow to accept question
changes. It will block as well people’s position and will make it an
order of magnitude much harder to establish trust in the process and to
allow evolution. It will delay by 6 months any decisions and won’t
resolve anything. Chances are that it leads to actually a major crisis.

<span id="_Toc14541021" class="anchor"></span>Annex 2 – Changes to the
incubation question text

Currently the hosting question changed its text in the following way to
represent the incubation management:

**Motivation**

*SG17 needs to be proactive and prompt in studying emerging areas in
order to secure new emerging telecommunication/ICT based services and
applications. Incubation function enables SG17 to introduce new work
items in an efficient manner in the emerging areas.*

**Question**

*g)      How should SG17 study new emerging areas to protect global
telecommunication/ICT infrastructures from the threats and challenges of
the evolving cybersecurity landscape including new emerging services and
applications?*

**Tasks**

*k)      Collaborate with all other Questions in ITU-T SG17 to
coordinate incubation* *function.  
l)        Incorporate incubation function to address the new emerging
areas in ITU-T* *SG17.*

<span id="_Toc14541022" class="anchor"></span>Annex 3 – Proposed
template elements for reporting

This section proposes a template text to be included in Q4 report (the
current incubation host question) to document the status and assessment
of the Incubation Mechanism for consideration in the working party
closing plenary and

**Q4 Incubation Mechanism Report**

Q4 hosts the incubation management part of the incubation mechanism as
referred in \[TP.inno\]
