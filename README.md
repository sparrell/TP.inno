# TP.inno
This repo is an experiment
for ITU SG17 q4 drafting TP.inno -
Technical Paper on
"Description of the incubation mechanism and ways to improve it".
Traditional ITU methods involve
'contributions' from members suggesting revisions and
creating new versions in "Temporary Documents" at meetings of SG17.
This is an attempt to try a different method using github.
