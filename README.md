# TP.inno
This repo is an experiment
for ITU SG17 q4 drafting TP.inno -
Technical Paper on
"Description of the incubation mechanism and ways to improve it".
Traditional ITU methods involve
'contributions' from members suggesting revisions and
creating new versions in "Temporary Documents" at meetings of SG17.
This is an attempt to try a different method using github.

The directory Example1 (hotlink it) contains
a contrived example of how
to switch from old methods to this proposed method.
It starts with the agreed text of TP.inno
from Aug-2019 SG17 meeting
(ie  to get the process started,
it gives method of converting word to markdown and committing)
and 'contributes' the Broadcom C.823 contribution
using this new method.
In other words, it recreates history pretending
this method had previously existed.

Example 2 (hotlink it) contains another contrived example
suggesting some changes to current text.
